As a Full Stack Software Engineer at QuintoAndar since 2021, I thrive on building robust, end-to-end solutions. I enjoy the challenge of working across the entire stack, from tackling tricky backend logic to creating seamless user experiences. While I am skilled in both, I hold a strong preference for backend development.

On the frontend, I leverage React, Next.js, and TypeScript/JavaScript to build fast, SEO-friendly websites that users love.

For the backend, I focus on developing high-performance, observable microservices using Java and the Spring framework.

I love digging into complex problems and hunting down bugs üêû, always with a focus on improving system availability and throughput. I'm a graduate of the Information Systems program at the University of S√£o Paulo (USP).
